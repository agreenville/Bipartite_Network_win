Bipartite Network is based on DesktopDeployR by wleepang (https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR). 
It is a framework for deploying self-contained R-based applications to the desktop. It allows developers
to share R based applications to users as desktop applications by providing both a portable R executable
environment and a private application package library.
